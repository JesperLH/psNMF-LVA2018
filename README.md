# psNMF-LVA2018
This repository contains functions for running Probabilistic Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (psNMF) and its non-sparse counterpart probabilistic NMF.

The aim of NMF is to factorize a data matrix X into two latent matrices W and H, such that X = W*H. This tool facilitates the scenarios where,

1) W and/or H follows a truncated normal distribution.
2) W and/or H follows an exponential distribution.
3) W or H follows a Uniform(0,1) distribution

In addition, for 1) and 2) the scale of the distribution can be either,

a) Fixed to a scalar value

b) Enforce column-wise sparsity (i.e. automatic relevance determination)

c) Enforce element-wise sparsity (i.e. discover an underlying sparse pattern)

## Getting started

1) For a simple demostration, Run 'demo_psNMF.m'
2) For recreating the results shown in [1], run 'demo_reproduce_lva_results.m'. This will take some time to run.
3) For more details read the documentation in 'VB_CP_ALS.m'
